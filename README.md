# compVision
This is a computer vision wrapper module along with pratical applications at the NSLS-2 facility at Brookhaven National Lab.
This work was done at the Inelastic X-ray Scattering (IXS) 10-ID Beamline At the National Synchrotron Light Source - 2 at BNL. Upon Integration with EPICS, these programs will be more usefull.
